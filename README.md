# Conway's Game of Life
Implementation of Conway's Game of life in Python using dictionaries. Cells stored
as a tuple of booleans, the first for whether the cell is alive (True) or dead (False), 
and the second for whether the cell will be alive the next turn. Each key is a tuple
storing the coordinate ``(x, y)`` of the cell.
